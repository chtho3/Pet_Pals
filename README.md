# Pet_Pals
Heroku Deployment Example Activity

* This Heroku activity is recommended to give students experience in deploying an application that they can then apply to their projects.

* If you have a preferred deployment method, you are more than welcome to share those with students and to send out third party tutorials on those

* In this activity, we will deploy a Pet Pals application to Heroku. The applications takes the name of a pet and plot it's location on the map. The actual code for the application is not nearly as import as the steps for deploying to Heroku. These steps can repeated for your own applications.

* This process consists of:

  1. Creating a repo for the application.
  2. Preparing the application with additional configuration files (`Procfile` and `requirements.txt`)
  3. Creating the Heroku application
  4. Preparing the Heroku database
